AttoBot requires the following permissions in order to work properly:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="general"
  values={[
    {label: 'General', value: 'general'},
    {label: 'Text', value: 'text'},
    {label: 'Voice', value: 'voice'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="general">
      Kick Members; Ban Members; Manage Nicknames; View Audit Log
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="text">
      Send Messages; Manage Messages; Embed Links; Attach Files; Read Message History; Add Reactions; Use External Emojis
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="voice">
      Connect; Speak; Use Voice Activity
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
To disable AttoBot in some channels, just revoke its permissions to view the channel and read the message history in that channel.
Commands executed in channels which AttoBot has no send messages permissions but has view channel permissions, will have its output DMed to the author.
