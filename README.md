# Sharkdoc Site Templates

This is a repository that aims to support `sharkdoc` CLI to create new developer and doc portals.

Each of those folders here is a template for a dev portal site. In order to generate your site, you should use the cli sharkdoc, inside the folder. Then it will invoke the information from govcenter to generate the pages automatically, or you can create your pages yourself.
