# Community Contributions Guide

If you want to elaborate on a topic or fix a typo, there is an "edit this page" button at the bottom of every article. This will direct you to GitHub and open the editor for that article to make your changes. Your changes will then be reviewed and approved by community members. You can also submit a PR manually if you want to. In any case, you would need a GitHub account.

For further guidance, see the first page of the [technical writer's](../for_tws/writer_guide.md) guide.
